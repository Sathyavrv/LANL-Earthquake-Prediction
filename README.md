**LANL Earthquake Prediction**
Forecasting earthquakes is one of the most crucial challenges in Earth science, significantly due to their devastating consequences. This project focuses on predicting the timing of laboratory earthquakes from real-time seismic data, a pivotal step towards advancing our understanding and prediction capabilities for seismic events.

**Overview**
The "LANL Earthquake Prediction" competition aims to use seismic signals for predicting the time remaining before laboratory earthquakes occur. This involves analyzing a continuous stream of seismic data to estimate the impending "time to failure" â€” a key metric indicating the likely time until the next seismic event. The dataset originates from a well-known experimental setup used to study the physics of earthquakes, offering a unique opportunity to explore and model earthquake precursors in a controlled environment.

**Goal**
The primary goal is to leverage the acoustic_data input signal to accurately predict the time_to_failure for laboratory earthquakes, contributing to the broader field of earthquake hazard assessments and potentially saving lives and infrastructure.
